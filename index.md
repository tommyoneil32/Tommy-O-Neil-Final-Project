title: Research on NFL Plays Data
author: Tommy O'Neil
description: The purpose of this research is to look at a potential correlation between the distance that a team has to go in order to get a first down and the yards that they end up gaining. I always found it interesting while watching football on how the perceived goal that they are trying to achieve ultimately effects the actual yardage they accumulate. It seems that there is sometimes a pronounced effect on strategy and resulting yardage gained when it comes to yards needed to obtain the first down.
